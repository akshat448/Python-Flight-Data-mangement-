# Python-Flight-Data-mangement-program
Objective

The objective of this project is to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application in Python that allows the user to manage flight information and store it in a database. The application should provide an easy-to-use interface for adding, updating, and viewing flight details. It can easily be understood and used by anyone, even without any formal computer education. It is very agile programme which can be used on any system, it itself makes database and inserts data in it.

Hardware – Software Requirements:
The Hardware and software requirements for the development phase of our project are as below- 
• Software Requirements:
1)	To compile code, we will require: 
➢ Python 3 for windows
2)	To run the Code: 
➢ Window 10 and above 
➢ sqllite3 for Windows 
• Hardware Requirements 
3)	Desktop/Laptop

Scope of Project:
The application uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI, sqlite3 to create and manage a database, tkcalendar and tkinter.messagebox to provide user-friendly input and feedback mechanisms. The application provides functionality to add and view flight information, including flight ID, name, email, phone number, gender, date of birth, departure and arrival location, and departure and arrival time.
